I was included in the whole process of development. Starting with planning and selecting tasks that were added to the Kanban board on Trello.

The same mentioned in the Comic shelf project. I was helping in development of proof of concept for this app. It was my first time seeing such complex framework with all levels of abstraction. First time I was writing and modifying tests written in xUnit. We were trying to keep the process as real as possible, splitting issues into smaller isolated form, make code review.

Two developers and a person with too much experience in playing and exploring indie games world were trying to create something that they would like. The concept for this project was based on classic logic learning where the user is introduced to new techniques while moving with levels. The goal was to use available tools, such as ramps or trampolines to transport a ball from the starting point to a certain point, resolving small tasks for points. There were two states, design state when the user was able to modify the environment to reach the goal and phase of validation that the user was only able to observe without any interactions. My responsibilities in this project mainly focused on exploring Unity environment, finding the way to solve problems. I made the majority of the code that was created during this project. I was also cooperating and paired programming with the second developer in the team. We did meetings every week and discussed progress and next steps. On each of those, I was presenting a demo to our third friend that was in the role of the project manager. What did I learn in this project is probably the most interesting. The most important would be basic knowledge of Unity, how to work with scenes, animations, how to use available physics, make UI, load asserts, manipulate objects, attach behaviors.
